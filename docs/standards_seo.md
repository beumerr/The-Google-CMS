| #Nr | Allergic to | Reaction| Why |
|--|--|--|--|
| **#1**| Mobile first content | :skull: | Recently Google announced that content, visible on mobile devices, will be primary for indexing.
| **#2**| No psychology  | :skull: | Psychology isn't measured by Google but  [increases CTR](%5Bhttps://buzzsumo.com/blog/most-shared-headlines-study/%5D%28https://buzzsumo.com/blog/most-shared-headlines-study/%29) which increases page ranking (especially combined with social media). 
| **#3**| No keyword research | :skull: | Using the [keyword planner](https://ads.google.com/intl/nl_nl/home/tools/keyword-planner/) tool you can research relative terms which evaluates the amount of competition, searches and a lot more. This should always be done before writing content | 
| **#4**| No long-tail keywords| :skull: | Long-tail keyword specify terms further and increases conversion rates with less competition.  
| **#5**| Duplicated content | :skull: | By simple changing a couple of words you won't make it. Either canonical tag must be set or the content must be unique. 
| **#6**| Bad keyword occurrence| :skull: | I'm not talking about the outdated keyword meta tag. At least 1 focus keyword should be assigned to each page and should occur multiple times across different content type like slug, title, meta's, content and alt-tags.
| **#7**| First 150 words | :skull: | The first 150 words are very important and will be seen as primary content, include the focus keyword at least in this section
| **#8**| Bad slugs | :skull: | Slugs should be readable to visitors with logic data structures. They also must contain the focus keyword  
| **#9**| Not enough words | :skull: | The proper amount of words is widely speculated as we believe 1000 would put some meat on the bone and 5000 brings you glory. Less words means Google can't properly determent what the page is about.
| **#10**| Dwell time | :skull: | Dwell time is really important to reduce the bounce ratio (visitors leaving after a few seconds). If visitors leave quickly your content will be marked as low quality content
| **#11**| To small or big meta titles| :skull: | To small means you haven't put enough keyword in it. To big means it won't be visible in the search results. Character count should be between 45 and 55. 
| **#12**| To small or big meta descriptions | :skull: | A meta description should be anywhere between 140 - 155 characters
| **#13** | No rich snippets | :skull: | Rich snippets can lead up to a [516% increase in session](https://searchengineland.com/seo-featured-snippets-leads-big-gains-236212) and quadruple CTR.
| **#14**| Single page sites | :skull: | Although single page sites are very popular here are [5 reasons why they are bad for SEO](https://seo-hacker.com/single-page-websites-bad-seo/)
| **#15**| Titles without paragraphs | :broken_heart: | Just like you are writing report, every header must have at least 1 paragraph
| **#16**| More than one H1 tag | :broken_heart: | The tag almost amplifies it. Every page should only have one H1 tag and it should be the best constructed sentence on the whole page.
| **#17**| OG meta tags| :broken_heart: | Sounds like kush :herb: but it isn't. When a link is shared across social media platforms you can customize the content with open paragraph tags (and click bait :smiling_imp:) 
| **#18**| No social media buttons | :broken_heart: | Implementing social media buttons creates a signal you are active and trustful
| **#19**| No internal linking | :lemon: | Internal linking is a good way to keep your visitor on your site which improves page ranking
| **#20**| No alt tags | :lemon: | Images must always have alt tags to improve indexing, preferable containing a keyword
| **#21**| Keyword synonyms (LSI) | :lemon: | Almost every keyword has a synonym with the same meaning. Make sure to use synonyms for a focus keywords so the page can be found on different phrases
| **#22**| No Outbound links | :lemon: | According early logic outbound links tell search engines their content is more important.. Well not anymore. They increase trustworthiness and Google likes it. Just don't do it too much
