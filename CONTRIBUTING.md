Before you start contributing its important to read the [software design description](https://github.com/beumerr/quaco/tree/master/docs). This document will give you a brief explaination about important development aspects like:

 - Deployment

 - Bootstrapping

## How Can I Contribute?

Contributing can be done in a lot of ways since this project has just been started. You can have a look at our [issue board](https://github.com/beumerr/quaco/issues), but we prefer that you continue to read this section before you do so. 

Currently there arent much open issues, because maintaining them takes a lot of time. If you have any experience on one of these fields then please [join us on discord](https://discord.gg/dxVNGtJ). We can have a chat and see what you like to do.

We need:
 - Open source management experience

 - Experienced Front-end developers
 - Database experts
 - UI designers
 - UML masters
 - JS/CSS3 animators

 - Investors

If you truely feel like this is a project in which you would like to invest a longterm relationship with then you can be part of the core development group :bow: :bride_with_veil: :bow:


### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to QuaCo? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* `Beginner issues` - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* `Help wanted issues` - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

Contributing works in these 6 steps:
1. Fork 
2. Clone
3. Work your issue out 
4. Commit [this is what your messasage should look like](#git-commit-messages)
5. Push to origin
6. Create a pull request

[Detailed explaination for step 1 - 5](https://help.github.com/en/articles/committing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
[Detailed explaination for step 6](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request#changing-the-branch-range-and-destination-repository)

 
### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title
