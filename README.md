### Quaco is a CMS where everything revolves around search engine optimization and theme development; from the technical side to content writing.

 1. *Are you a web developer, SEO fanatic or content writer?*
 2. *Are visitor numbers important for your project?*
 3. *Do you want to build high-end themes even more quickly than with WordPress?*
 4. *Do you want to bring you and your clients a lot of revenue?*
 5. *Do you want to get your websites to #1 on Google?*

## 10 reasons why Quaco might interest you

1.  It validates and offers feedback on content according to the latest Google SEO guidelines.
2.  It doesn't have plugins that load a shit ton of JS, CSS and queries that slow down your theme.
3.  It doesn't have plugins with free and premium versions full of commercial junk.
4.  Plugins that are developed by third-parties are validated against strict guidelines.
5.  Homepages are composed by about 4 queries instead of 56 as with WordPress.
6.  It will help make your front-end and back-end super fast (Google judges by this).
7.  The development of real-time themes (by means of XML requests and PHP / HTML) is not yet properly supported.
8.  WordPress has been conquered by do-it-your-selfers which increases the productivity of the CMS but the quality and speed is not good enough for websites with commercial goals.
9.  It is a system that only does what it has to do.
10. Google is like a god to us

## On these 4 rules we've risen from the ashes

1.  **The technical side of your theme must be perfect and lightning fast** -
The "Quaco speed optimiser" module provides the programmer with technical control and feedback for a theme. The module is inspired by GTmetrix, Google Speed ​​Insight and WP Rocket. The module forms a combination of these 3 masters exclusively for your theme development.

2.  **Written content must be checked according the latest Google SEO guidelines** - 
The "Quaco quality content" module ensures that every author becomes an SEO expert. The module calculates written content based on as many as 200 SEO factors. As the way Google indexes your website, this module evaluates written content. WordPress connoisseurs may now think of Yoast SEO, but Quaco is taking a big step ahead of it with many more factors and in-depth feedback.

3.  **The development of plugins and themes must be simple and well-documented** - 
Through our up-to-date documentation, developers can easily develop themes and plugins themselves. Quaco maintains an archive full of certified plugins. However, the plug-ins do not call out a ready-made design. The idea is that developers write CSS themselves. Every customer has a unique project, and we have seen enough bootstrap styling in the meantime... no?

4.  **Google optimisation** - 
In every design decision, in every line of code, in every character, Google is taken into consideration. If Google says kneel, we kneel.
