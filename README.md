 1. *Are you a web developer, SEO fanatic or content writer?*
 2. *Are visitors numbers important for your project?*
 3. *Do you want to build high-end themes even quicker than WordPress?*

**Then Quaco brings you the solution**

Quaco is a CMS where everything revolves around search engine optimization and theme development. From the technical side to content writing.

## 10 reason why Quaco might intrest you

1.  A CMS should validate and offer feedback on content according to the latest Google SEO guidelines.
2.  A plugin shouldn't load a shit ton of JS, CSS and queries that slow down your theme.
3.  Plugins with free and premium versions full of commercial junk do not belong in a CMS.
4.  Plugins that are developed by third-parties should be validated on strict aspects.
5.  A homepage is composed by about 4 queries instead of 56 as with WordPress.
6.  A front-end and back-end must be super fast, partly because Google judged this.
7.  The development of real-time themes (by means of XML requests and PHP / HTML.) is not yet properly supported.
8.  WordPress has been conquered by do-it-your-selfers which increases the productivity of the CMS but the quality and speed is not good enough for websites with commercial goals.
9.  A system should only do what it has to do.
10. Google is like god to you

## On these 4 rules we've risen from the ashes

1.  **The technical side of your theme must be perfect and lightning fast**
The "Quaco speed optimiser" module provides the programmer with technical control and feedback for the theme. The module is inspired by GTmetrix, Google Speed ​​Insight and WP Rocket. The module forms a combination of these 3 masters exclusively for your theme development.

2.  **Written content must be checked according the latest Google SEO guidelines**
The "Quaco quality content" module ensures that every author becomes an SEO expert. The module calculates written content based on as many as 200 SEO factors. As the way Google indexes your website, this module evaluates written content. Wordpress connoisseurs may now think of Yoast SEO, but Quaco is taking a big step on top of that with many more factors and in-depth feedback.

3.  **The development of plugins and themes must be simple and well-documented**
Through our up-to-date documentation, developers can easily develop themes and plugins themselves. Quaco maintains an archive full of certified plugins. However, the plug-ins do not call out a ready-made design. The idea is that developers write CSS themselves. Every customer is a unique project and we have seen enough bootstrap styling in the meantime .. no?

4.  **Google is god**
In every design decision, in every line of code, in every character Google is taken into consideration. If he says kneel, we kneel.
